# Exercise
Given an input string like `'aaaabbbcca'`, write a function that outputs sequences
of equal letters as an array of 2-length arrays containing the letter and the number
of repetitions, like `[['a', 4], ['b', 3], ['c', 2], ['a', 1]]` for the previous
input

# Bonus
Write the opposite function to transform the array of arrays into the original string
